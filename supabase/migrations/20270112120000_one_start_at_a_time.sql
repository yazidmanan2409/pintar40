-- SYSTEM INTEGRITY GATE · SI-D02 (9 Nov): AN ATTEMPT LIMIT HOLDS UNDER CONCURRENT STARTS.
--
-- may_start_assessment counts the learner's sittings of an assignment against the definition's attempt_limit with a
-- plain count(*), and start_learning_session then inserts the sitting. Nothing locked the pair. Proven by a
-- deterministic two-connection test (selftest/run.ts SI-D02-R01): with attempt_limit 1 and no sitting yet, connection A
-- started and held its transaction open; connection B's start completed in 0.07 s and saw only its own sitting, so
-- both commits would have left two attempts against a limit of one (a double tap or two devices suffice). Found by the
-- D-125 investigation (docs/completion-4.1/C1-D125-INVESTIGATION.md §5, red case 4); confirmed by Sharon (9 Nov).
--
-- The correction is the narrowest: a transaction-scoped advisory lock per (learner, assignment) at the top of
-- start_learning_session, before the count. The function is otherwise exactly its current definition
-- (20270111100000). It is independent of 4.1's C1 (the controller generation) and is not C1.
